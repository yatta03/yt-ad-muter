# youtube-ad-muter

![icon](./extension/images/icon_128.svg)  
it's a google extension that do:

on Youtute (and only on Youtube)

- mute ad if detected
- skip ad if the ad is skippable and auto-skip option is set to True

## usage

```
git clone https://github.com/yatta03/yt-ad-muter.git
```

open your chrome -> manage extenstion -> developer mode -> 載入未封裝項目 -> select yt-ad-muter/extension -> done :heavy_check_mark:

click icon to toggle mute and skip ad function

---

## future plan

- work on Youtube Music

the skip function doesn't work for me, and making it work is currently beyond my capability, maybe fix it someday...
